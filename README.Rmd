<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of RUHi is to analyze and visualize mFISH spatial transcriptomic data!

## Installation

You can install RUHi from this github repo with:

``` r
install_github("kaitsull/RUHi")
```

## Examples

Currently the package has 2 functions:
`ruMake`  
- creates a table containing all of the quantified genes  
  
`goFISH`  
- launches the gone mFISHing shiny app (must use table generated via ruMake)

Plus the original functions by Mark Cembrowski:
`loadData`, `plotCluster`, `plotGene`, `plotViolin`
